        There are 26 letters of the English alphabet, but there are 44 sounds of English.
        Kids learn letters, but they also need to learn phonemes and graphemes. And once they’ve
        gotten that, they need to segment,
        blend, and manipulate sounds. Let’s break all that down and look at some ways
        to teach the 44 sounds of English.Phonemes are basic units of sounds.
        There are 44 phonemes that can be blended to form additional sounds.Graphemes are
        the way we write phonemes. You can have a one letter grapheme or
        multi-letter grapheme. For example, digraphs are two-letter graphemes that represent
        one phoneme or two letters that represent one sound. You can also have three- or
        four-letter graphemes.
